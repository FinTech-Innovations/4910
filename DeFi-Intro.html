#  Evolution of Market Exchange

## 1. Barter - P2P exchange of goods and services
- #### Inefficient because supply and demand had to be **exactly** matched 

## 2. Physical money 
 - ### Stones, shells etc. - inconvenient, no tangible value
 - ### Specie money (gold,silver) - inconvenient, money had tangible value
 - ### Fiat money (bills, currency) - non-collateralized, controlled by central banks, requires trust in issuing authority

---
## 3. Non physical  money
 - #### Wire transfers and Checks (1871) - Western Union
 - #### Credit cards (1950) - Diner's card
 - #### ATM (1967) - Barclay's bank
 - #### Telephone Banking (1983) - Bank of Scotland
 - #### Internet Banking (1994) - Stanford Federal Credit Union
 - #### RFID payment (1997) - Mobil Speedpass
 - #### Chip and Pin credit cards (2005)
 - #### Apple Pay/Paypal/Venmo (2014)

# So, what does history reveal?

--

 &gt; - ## Inefficiencies (costs) lead to innovations
 &gt; - ## Financial services industry has constantly been **disrupted** by "new" technology

#  FinTech = Fin + Tech

- ## As a buzzword, its new!
 ### ... but Finance and Technology are not new!
 
- ## So, what's new this time around?

 - ### Who are the innovators?
 - ### What is the inefficiency that innovation is trying to solve? 
 
---

# The Players

## Historical trailblazers
- ### Central banks and financial institutions

## Current trailblazers
- ### Tech companies

&gt; ## Google, Amazon, Facebook taking on **finance functions** like **payments, lending and investment**
  
---

# Why Tech firms?

 - ### Big data boom and unparalleled access to consumer data
 
 - ### Not subject to regulations like financial institutions

&gt; ### Aggressive in taking risks: **new products, technology and markets**


---

# Traditional banking services:

  - ### Payment services - deposit accounts

  - ### Lending services - personal/business loans, credit cards

  - ### Capital raising - investment banking (issue stock and bonds)

  - ### Investment advisory - investment/trading/brokerage/settlement

  - ### Wealth management - Private banking (bespoke investing)

--
 
&gt; ## All involve **moving** or **raising** or **investing** *capital* and *money*

---

# FinTechs:

  - ### Payments - digital wallets (PayPal, Venmo), Cyptocurrencies (BTC, ETH)

  - ### Lending - P2P lending (LendingClub, Prosper, Kabbage)
 
  - ### Capital raising - crowdfunding, ICOs
 
  - ### Investment - robo-advisors (Wealthfront, Betterment)
 
  - ### Wealth management - Personal Finance (Credit Karma, Mint) 
  
--
  
&gt; ## Traditional banks threatened on all fronts **piece** by **piece**

---

# Industry in flux

## Finance is changing! 

&gt; ### "Silicon valley is coming.  There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking"
&gt; &lt;footer&gt;--- Jamie Dimon, CEO JPMorganChase&lt;/footer&gt;

## Traditional banks?

 - ### In danger of being technologically leapfrogged!



---

class: center, middle

# So, what is FinTech?

--

&gt; ##  It is **technological innovations** that improve how *money* and *capital* are **transferred, raised and invested**

# Centralized Financial System

## Exchange occurs in a centralized financial system 
 - ## Financial institutions intermediate exchange

  - ### Central banks create money, control money supply
  - ### Financial trading largely done via intermediaries (e.g. stock exchanges)
  - ### Borrowing and lending conducted through traditional banking institutions

---

# Problems of Centralized Financial Systems

### 1. Centralized control
- #### Consumers and businesses often deal with a single bank

### 2. Limited access
- #### Unbanked (1.7 billion people) - cannot obtain loans, participate in internet commerce
- #### Underbanked populations - banks may not bother with small business loans, credit card rates too high (&gt;20%), resort to payday lending (&gt;100%!)

### 3. Inefficiency
- #### Fees - credit card interchange (3%); remittance (5-7%); diret and indirect brokerage fees
- #### Speed - costly (slow) transfer of funds

---

# Problems of Centralized Financial Systems

### 4. Lack of interoperatbility
- #### Consumers and businesses face high switching costs with financial institutions

### 5. Opacity
- #### Lack of transparency about the institution - requires faith and trust in government protections (FDIC, SIPC etc.)
- #### Search costs are high (e.g. figuring out the "lowest" interest rate)

# Decentralized Finance

- ## While the medium of exchange, i.e. money evolved....the infrastructure of exchange remained unchanged
- ## DeFi is a repsonse to the inefficiencies associated with centralized finance - innovation in financial system infrastructure
  
  - ### Build and combine financial building blocks (primitives) into sophisticated financial products
  - ### Interact with peers via a common ledger not controlled by any centralized organization
---

class: center, middle

# So, what is DeFi?

--

&gt; ##  It is a competitive marketplace of decentralized financial applications that function as various financial "primitives" such as exchange, save, lend and tokenize.

# 1. Blockchain

- ## Decentralizing backbone for all DeFi
- ## There is no **""the"** blockchain...its a technology
 - ### It is not bitcoin! Bitcoin uses blockchain technology
- ## It is a distributed ledger where software protocols allow multiple parties to operate under shared assumptions and data without trusting each other

---

# It is a distributed ledger
![Blockchain1](Images\distributed_ledgers_explained.png)
---
# Block + Chain
- ##  "Block" are "chained" together cryptographically
  - ### A block is a record that contain an index, a **timestamp**, transactions data,  the **hash** of the current block, and a hash pointer as a link to a previous block
  - ### The hash is generated from all the information in the block. If the block changes , the hash changes!
  ![Blocks](Images\Blocks.png)
---
# A special kind of distributed ledger - Append only!
![Blockchain2](Images\Distributed_ledgers2.png)
---

# Consensus Network verification 

- ## Consensus protocol
  - ### A set of rules that determine what kinds of block can become part of the chain and become **"truth"**
  - ### e.g. PoW - computationally intensive lottery (mining) to determine which block to add - longest chain of blocks is the "truth"
  - ### e.g. PoS - validators commit some capital (their stake) to attest that block is valid

---
# Consensus - PoW example

![Consensus](Images\Consensus_Block.png)

---

# 2. Cryptocurrency
- ## A popular application of blockchain technology
- ## A token that is cryptographically secured and transferred
  - ### Asymmetric key cryptography: "Public" key representing address to receive tokens and "private" key to unlock and spend tokens
  - ### Avoids duplicability of digital assets (no double spend!)
- ## e.g. Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH)

---

# Bitcoin

![Bitcoin](Images\Bitcoin-mining.jpg)
---
# 3. Smart Contract Platforms

- ## Blockchains that go beyond simple payment networks like Bitcoin and allow for the creation of **smart contracts** that enahnce the capabilites of the chain itself
  - ### **Smart contracts** code that lives on the blockchain that controls assets and data and defines interactions between data, assets and network participants 
- ## Ethereum platform, Ether (ETH) token, smart contracts using ETH

---
# Decentralized Applications (dApps)

- ## Similar to traditional software applications, but live on the blockchain built with  smart contracts
- ## Peers interact directly without the need for a company to act as a central clearing house. e.g. land titling
- ## DeFi = dApps
  - ### building and combining financial building blocks (primitives such as exchange, lend, tokenize) into sophisticated products that minimize frictions and maximize value
  
---
# 4. Oracles

- ## Any data source for reporting information external to the blockchain
- ## Connects the blockchain to the world outside the ledger (does the blockchain know what the level of the S&amp;P 500 index is?)
- ## Enhances the ability to develop dApps

---
# Oracle Challenge
- ## How can we create an oracle that can authoritatively speak about off-chain information in a trust-minimized way?
  - ### host own oracle, or hook into an existing one from a well-trusted platform
- ## Chainlink - Etherium based platform that hooks into an aggregation of data sources

---
#.5. Stablecoins

- ## Maintain price parity with some target asset (USD, gold)
  - ### Avoids the price volatility of cryptocurrencies like BTC
- ## Peg mechanism
 - ### Fiat-collateralized (USD) - Tether (USDT)
 - ### Crypto-collateralized (ETH) - DAI (created by MakerDAO)
 - ### Non-collateralized - algorithimc expansion and contraction of supply to shift the price of the peg - Empty Set Dollar (ESD), Ampleforth (AMPL)
