# Equity Based Crowdfunding

- Accredited investors SEC 

JOBS Act allowed small companies to raise capital from non-accredited investors.

  Simple filing requirements
  Similar to kickstarter type projects
  Origination fee of about 5% by the platforms
  Platforms sometimes take an equity stake. Skin in the game. Conflict of interest.

Reg D/Equity I - Unlimited offering to accredited investors
  e.g: Angellist
