Used to fund a project with uncertain cash flow
<br/>

--
A novel way of financing without seeking for venture capital.
  * Connect projects with funders

class: inverse, middle, center

# Rewards Based Crowdfunding
---
 
 # Reward based 
 
 * Pre-sell products or services
 
 * Proceed if the minimum funding goal is met
 
 * Participants are not speculating. Just want the product or the service.
 
 * No punishment if the development is unsuccessful
 
 * Successful projects can lead to potential VC attention.
 
 * e.g: kickstarter, e.g: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ryangrepper/coolest-cooler-21st-century-cooler-thats-actually

# Equity Based Crowdfunding


* Average investor was not able to invest in private equity
  * Only accredited investors (income more than 200k or net wealth more than 1 million)
  
* JOBS Act allowed small companies to raise capital from non-accredited investors.

* Investors receive an equity stake in the start-up

# Crypto Based Crowdfunding (ICOs)

---

# What is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?
* Used to  raise money for younger startups by going around the capital markets

--
* Individuals are offered digital assets that represent products or services 
  
--
* Raise funding through a Blockchain
  - Anyone can use Bitcoin source code to create own coins
  - The standardized the coding for creating a token in Ethereum made it easy to create new coins

???
 a significant innovation in entrepreneurial finance
 
Venture capital firms (VCs) concentrated in a few areas such as Silicon Valley are the dominant investors. For entrepreneurs seeking capital, physical proximity to and personal connections with VCs are crucial 

permit a broader range of individuals to invest in high-risk, high-reward new ventures while enabling entrepreneurs who lack access to networks of conventional investors to raise financing

# Some words of caution 
* More than 95%  of the ICOs have no working product. 3/4 is just based on an idea
* Etherium was just based on email. Bitcoin exchange for email. Private key when the genesis block is created. 
* Compared to kickstarter
 - Liquid secondary market. Tokens are tradable for cryptocurrency or fiat currency within a few days of the ICO
 - Digital assets
 - Profits through appreciation

---

# There are many ICO related scams

* Easy

* No regulatory requirements

* Can be based on just an idea

* FOMO - trying to get in at the bottom

* No mechanism to prevent the issuer from absconding with the ICO proceeds

* There is no accountability or oversight of promotersâ€™ use of proceeds
