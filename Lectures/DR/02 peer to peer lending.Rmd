#  Regulation tightening in China

--

- China became a major fintech market power post financial crisis as investors flocked to peer-to-peer platforms searching for higher yield
  * By July 2017, there were 5029 P2P platforms with over 1.09 trillion RMB (163 billion USD) in outstanding loans
  * 69% of the population used fintech services
--

- The downfall of Ezubao in 2015 highlighted the risks in peer-to-peer lending. 1/3 fintech lenders had cash shortage problems.
  * Created fictional borrowers and funneled money to own business

---

#  Regulation tightening in China

--

- Concerns about loan sharking, identity theft, consumer privacy violations, and misleading marketing

--

- Security breaches 

--
- Regulators imposed stricter regulations
  * Appointment of custodian banks
  * Disclosure requirements on the use of investments
  * Caps on the maximum lending amounts 
  
???
 some Chinese P2P platforms monitored the borrowers’ smartphone use without permission, and collected data such as phone contact lists, call logs, and location services to track defaulting borrowers and harass their family and friends
 
Online lenders on Jiedaibao, a P2P platform, targeted female college student borrowers and demanded “naked loans” - nude photos and videos as collateral to be eligible for higher loan amounts. Lenders threatened to publish the photos online if the payments were not on time
