# Origins of Credit Cards  
- ## Checks (and e-checks/ACH) are not an optimal or time-critical transactions 
  - ### Settlement (transfer of money) is not real time!
      - #### Think of paying for dinner at a restaurant using paper checks or wire-transfer!
- ## Quicker solution? Bank temporarily fronts the money for the purchase - Instant cashless transactions!
    - ### Digital wallets speed up the process, but credit cards were first! 


---

# Credit Card Operation
- ## Bank extends revolving line of credit to customer
- ## Guarantees real-time availability of funds to merchant
- ## Builds a real-time messaging network to communicate this guarantee
- ## Bills customer later (and bears default risk)
- ## Charges merchant for these costs

???

- There are four parties involved, the paying consumer, the receiving merchant, and their banks. We will call the consumer's bank the issuer because they issue the credit card and the underlying loan. The merchant's bank is called the acquirer and that's where the merchant has their bank accounts to receive money. And in the middle as usual, we'll have an electronic communications network. Now we'll use Visa as the example.

- The consumer first applies for a revolving line of credit from the bank.

- Once approved, the bank will issue them a credit card that has their credit account information, that is the card number and the expiration date printed on the card and embedded in the chip and the magnetic stripe.

- Now, the consumer takes it to a store., swipes it to buy a hundred dollars worth of stuff. In order to do that, we're going to need an additional sixth party involved called the processors. They are the providers of the terminal,the hardware, and the software to capture the card information and send it onward to the card network. They can be either affiliated with incumbent financial institutions or they can be fintech startups acting as independent sales organizations or ISOs.

- Swiping or inserting the card itself simply sends the account information combined with a payment amount information by the processor's hardware and software, in an encrypted form to the network like a text message.

- The network itself then simply forward the message to the issuer. It is not an ACH Network -- there's no batch processing here and every message is routed through in real time just like a cell phone network.

- Once the information gets to the issuer, the issuer performs several key intermediation tasks in quick succession -  verify that the consumer has the account, the charge does not exceed the amount of the available loan, and do a quick risk assessment about how likely this transaction might be fraudulent,  Once everything checks out, the issuer sends an approval message which will again be routed through the card network to the merchant showing up as approved on the processing device and maybe printing a receipt.

- All of these are highly automated and would happen within a couple of seconds. Then the consumer conveniently takes the product home and their business withthe merchant is concluded.

- As usual,this is only half of the picture. As settlement, the actual money flow happens later on
other rails either ACH or bank wire.

# Credit Card Network: Payment for services

???

- But wait a minute, each party has to be compensated for making this convenience happen. So instead of transferring the full $100 to the merchants, each party will take their slice of this pie. We'll have a deeper look at how the pie is divided, but for now note that the issuer will take the biggest piece of the pie for their intermediation tasks. Their compensation is called the interchange fee and can range up to 2 to 3% depending on the bank. In this example,we're using a 2.15% interchange fee. So the issuer will keep $2.15 for the compensation and transfer only 97.85 to the merchant's bank.

- The acquirer will also take a cut here, pulling 0.15% or 15 basis points as the acquiring fee for simply having the merchant's bank account there to receive money.

- And just like a cell phone company charging for each call or message, the network itself will have an assessment for this communication charging in this example, 15 basis points.

- And finally for providing the hardware and software to accept the credit card and process the transaction information, the processors will charge a processing fee in this case, 5 basis points.

- So if you sum these all up, the merchant is getting far less than the full $100. In this example, after four parties taking their cuts, only 97.50 is transferred to the merchant's account, leaving 2.5% as the total transaction cost.

- This is a business cost for the merchants to accept credit cards. So eventually, either they will pass them on to the consumers either directly as a credit card surcharge or indirectly in their prices. Or smaller merchants won't even be able to afford so they won't take credit cards.

-  And the settlement process is not over yet because the loan has to be repaid. The bank will send the customer a bill at the end of the billing period and the customer then chooses to either pay back immediately, pay later with interest rate charged or to default on this loan. But this process is completely between the issuer and the consumer and is decoupled from the actual transaction.

# Credit Card Network: Business model

- ## Network operators: High fixed costs, low marginal costs
  - ## High barriers to entry; scalable 
      - ### Visa and Mastercard are similar to cell phone companies
  - ## Set overall fee for transactions, and negotiate division of fees across parties

---

# Credit Card Network: Business model

- ## Other players: Fees depend on risk exposure of each party
  - ## Issuer bank: highest risk = highest fee
      - ### risk of customer default, fraud; fee compensates for authentication and risk management services
  - ## Acquirer bank: smaller risk; simply holds the merchant's account
  - ## Processor: least risk; provide hardware and software to merchants; not financial institutions
  
---

# **Key Point**

&gt; # PayTech players compete on tech rather than financial risk-taking; They are independent payment processors (PayPal, Square, Stripe)

---

# Advantages 

- ### Speed!- Communications sent and received in real time
- ### Less risk for merchants - bank pays not customer (also process debit and prepaid cards)
- ### Value added services for consumers - its a line of credit!; perks (FF miles); dispute resolution; fraud detection and prevention
  
 
&gt; ## PayTech pentration is low when credit card penetration is high (US) and vice-versa (China, India)!
  
---

# Drawbacks 

- ## **Security**
  - ## Strong security at back end (newtorks and banks), but weak at front end (POS)
      - ### Offline transactions: No encryption (until recently) - card skimming using smoothing device of physical copy!
      - ### Online transacations: No unified standard for account number security - merchants can be hacked (e.g. Target)
      
---

# Inefficiencies (related to business model)

- ## **Limited customer base on both sides** 
  - ## Merchants (Amex not accepted!)
      - ### High upfront (hardware) &amp; ongoing (software, processing fee) costs 
      - ### Lack of cheap value added services (e.g. CRM, inventory management, tax prep.)
  - ## Consumers 
      - ### Only available to those with a (good) credit history (unbanked)

# Security Innovations

## Flow of Information

.center[![CCFlowofInformation1](Images/Lec2-CCFlowofInformation1.png)]

???

- The most important piece of information in a credit card transaction is the account related numbers, that is your card number, the expiration date, and the three or four digit control codes.

- As we have already discussed, this information flows through multiple parties in a single transaction. In both online and offline transactions, account information flows from the customer via the processor to the merchant, then via the processor to the card network, then finally, to the issuing bank. 

- Now lets look at where the vulnerabilities lie (and opportunites for innovation)

---

# Security Innovations

## Flow of Information - vulnerabilities

.center[![CCFlowofInformation2](Images/Lec2-CCFlowofInformation2.png)]

???

- An attacker, called an adversary in cybersecurity parlance, has multiple potential attack points along this flow to try and capture the account information. But some points are more feasible than others.

- We could safely assume that security on the back-end is much higher. Client account information is a core asset of any bank, so they all invest heavily to beef-up their own security to the highest possible standard.

- Consequently, vulnerabilities mainly happen at the front end, that is either at the point of sale or close to it. Here, the banks and the networks have a lot less control, and this is precisely where the PAYTECH innovators come in. We have seen that they are best at front-end innovations. Here again, they're innovating at the front-end, this time, in the security aspect.

## EMV Technology (Chip cards)

.center[![CCFlowofInformation3](Images/Lec2-CCFlowofInformation3.png)]

???

- First, as we said before, account numbers can easily be stolen in a physical transaction by skimming. That is, using spoofing devices that looked like legitimate terminals to fool the customers into swapping their cards and thereby, given up all the unencrypted information stored in the magnetic stripes.

- This risk is primarily being addressed with the EMV technology spearheaded by the card networks. Or in everyday terms, we know this as the chip cards which is now standard in the United States.

- Lets look at how this works
  
---

# Regular credit card - magnetic strip

.center[![EMVTechnology1](Images/Lec2-EMVTechnology1.png)]

???

- This is good old credit card with a magnetic stripe. Stored on the stripe is the credit card number, the expiration date, plain and simple, not encrypted at all. So when you swipe it at a terminal the magnetic stripe is read, the card number is captured and then transmitted along the card network to the issuer. The undisguised nature of the information makes it vulnerable to skimming.
  
---

#  Chip card

.center[![EMVTechnology2](Images/Lec2-EMVTechnology2.png)]

&gt; ###The IC (Chip) performs a simple cryptographic function - it converts a fixed CC number into a **one-time random** number

???

- This is our standard chip card. The key difference is the chip which we now insert into a terminal instead of swiping.

- The chip is essentially a tiny little computer that when you insert it gets powered on and does one simple function. It does what's called a key exchange with the chip enabled terminal to convert the plain card number into a completely random number. 

- Every time it's different so this cannot be guessed. With this approach the terminal only captures the random number which then gets transmitted to the issuing bank for approval decisions.

- The issuer, simply speaking, possesses a key to quickly decrypt this back into the plain count number on their end. Then it transmits its approval decision back through the network to the terminal.

- The added step at the points-of-sale is the encryption and that's why chip card transactions generally take slightly longer than a card swipe. Moreover, the decryption only occurs at the bank end where security is much much higher. The only thing that the terminal transmits is the random number and the approve or decline decisions.

- Therefore skimming will become pointless, even if the skimmer captures the information, they cannot decrypt it without attacking the bank. So they cannot really guess the card number to duplicate and the information that they capture becomes worthless to the skimmer.

- So EMV is a good innovation for all physical transactions, but it doesn't really address the online vulnerabilities.

## Network Site Tokenization

.center[![CCFlowofInformation4](Images/Lec2-CCFlowofInformation4.png)]

???

- Second, we have seen that card information could also be stolen from the merchants if they're weakly encrypted there. This has been a big issue in this decade and the new technology solution to address this risk is called network site tokenization.

- Lets see how this works

---

# Network Site Tokenization

.center[![Tokenization1](Images/Lec2-Tokenization1.png)] 

&gt; ## Tokenization takes the role of encrypting and protecting the account information out of the hands of the merchants, and shifts them to a more specialized provider called a token vault.

???

- If the card number that you fill online is stored by the merchant, say when you click the save my payment info button, but stored in a vulnerable way, say in plain text an Excel file, an attacker could easily attack the merchant and obtain many card numbers in one swoop.

- Tokenization is essentially a service that takes the role of encrypting and protecting the account information out of the hands of the merchants, and shifts them to a more specialized provider called a token vault.

---

# Network Site Tokenization

.center[## Network Site Tokenization

.center[![Tokenization2](Images/Lec2-Tokenization2.png)] 


???

- What the vaults do is that once the credit card number is entered by the consumer, it first provides a one-way encryption function that again, turns this number into a completely different and random number all together.

- And only this number is stored on the merchant sites. This new random number is called a token.

- And just like EMV even if someone hacks the merchant and captures these tokens, it will be meaningless to them because only the token vaults have the decryption keys to turn them back into the plain numbers.

- So every time the card stored on the side is used, the vault simply decrypts the token gets the actual number then transmits through the card network to the issuing bank, where again the security is much higher. 
- In this regard, the token vaults are essentially third-party security technology innovators, and many players compete in this emerging space. Many card networks like Visa or Mastercard operate their own vaults. Some are operated by banks some by digital wallet companies like PayPal and some are cybersecurity startups.

# Security Innovations

##  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security

.center[![CCFlowofInformation5](Images/Lec2-CCFlowofInformation5.png)]

???
- Finally, adversaries could go directly to the consumers and try to steal account information there. For instance, by hacking malware on their computers, or just physically taking the card like in a restaurant.

- This risk is being addressed by a combination of tokenization and mobile hardware-based security. In the United States, the big players are Apple and Google.

---

#  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security: Apple Pay

.center[![ApplePayTech1](Images/Lec2-ApplePayTech1.png)]

???
- The consumer has a credit card that they want to use with say Apple Pay. If you have used it before you know that you first need to enroll the card.

---

#  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security: Apple Pay

.center[![ApplePayTech2](Images/Lec2-ApplePayTech2.png)]

???
- You'll fill in the card information on the phone, it is directly transmitted to the issuing bank which operates his own token vault. 

---

#  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security: Apple Pay

.center[![ApplePayTech3](Images/Lec2-ApplePayTech3.png)]

???
- Once the issuer receives the information, it runs through the encryption function and tokenizes,
converting it into again a random number.

---

#  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security: Apple Pay

.center[![ApplePayTech4](Images/Lec2-ApplePayTech4.png)]

???

- This random token is then transmitted back to the phone and hard locked into the phone.

- On an iPhone for instance, the token is stored in a separate secure storage element that's only accessible with a biometric layer of security like fingerprint or face recognition. 

---

#  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security: Apple Pay

.center[![ApplePayTech5](Images/Lec2-ApplePayTech5.png)]

???
- So when the consumer wants to use the enrolled card at a terminal that supports Apple Pay they first need to biometrically authenticate on the phone.

- Then the token stored on the phone acts like a credit card number and is used like EMV with the terminal to generate yet another random number. Because there's no physical card, this process is done wirelessly using near field communication, or NFC. 

---

#  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security: Apple Pay

.center[![ApplePayTech6](Images/Lec2-ApplePayTech6.png)]

???
- After that only the random number is transmitted throughout the network all the way back to the issuing bank.  

---

#  Tokenization + Mobile Hardware Based Security: Apple Pay

.center[![ApplePayTech7](Images/Lec2-ApplePayTech7.png)]

???
- which then can easily decrypt it and transmit the approval decision back to the terminal.

---

# Why has Apple (Google Pay) not taken off?
 - ## They emphasize convenience (NFC instead of swiping - really?!)
 - ## ...instead of **security** - a more secure tokenized transaction from end to end.
 
&gt; ## Key Point: Value proposition should be clear!
  - ### Focus on the best feature of technology
  - ### Don't sell toom many features in one setting!

---

# Expanding credit card usage base

- ## Remember the pain points: CC are expensive for merchants
  - ### high processing fee (not much can be done here - set by networkk operators)
  - ### requires investment in hardware and software
  - ### lack of value added services


&gt; ## PayTech innovations compete on lowering hardware and software costs, and on providing value added services for both offline and online merchants

---

# Offline Innovations (Square)

.center[![Square](Images/Lec2-square.jpg)]

---

# Offline Innovations (Square)

## Square is an independent payment processor
- ## Key idea: Lower up front cost for smaller **brick and mortar** merchants prefer convenience and low cost
  - ## Use existing device as POS terminal
  - ## Intuitive UI and simple reporting software
  - ## Eliminates the need for dedicated hardware

---

# Online Innovations (Stripe/PayPal)

.center[![Stripe](Images/Lec2-Stripe.png)]

---

# Online Innovations (Stripe)

## Stripe is an independent payment processor
- ## Key idea: Lower up front cost for smaller **online** merchants prefer convenience and low cost
  - ## Offer APIs (code snippets) as a conduit between the merchant's website and the back-end processing 
  - ## Eliminates setting up expensive online infrastructure to accept card payments
