# Outline

- ## 2.0: PayTech | Retail Payment Systems
  + ### Checking System
  + ### ACH
  
---

#Retail Payments  
 - ### usually involve C2C, C2B transactions 
  - #### or B2B transactions (wholesale payments)
  - #### higher transaction volumes and lower average dollar values than wholesale payment systems

--
 - ### where purchase of goods and services can occur:
    - #### at the point-of-sale (POS) (e.g., in person at a merchant, or unattended kiosks) 
    - #### remotely without physical presence at the POS, such as via the Internet or a telephone/mobile phone. 
    
--

- ### and occur through the use of various instruments
  - #### cash, checks, EFT, debit cards, credit cards, mobile phones...

# Check Clearing and Settlement inovlves two flows:
  
.center[![Check](Images/Lec2-CheckingSystem.png)]
--

- ## Flow of information (clearing)
- ## Flow of money (settlement)

---

# Compared to cash payments, these two flows are not synchronous!
- ## You get **information** that you will be paid before you are **actually paid**

--

- ## Time separation can result in fraud!

--

- ## Transaction failure due to asymmetric information
  
---

# Who provides the trust that you will get paid?

--

- ## **Financial intermediaries** 
  - ### solve the asymmetric information problem by putting in safeguards like,
      - #### reversibility of payments
      - #### pre-authorization of funds
      - #### electronic routing
      - #### advanced encryption etc.

---

# But trust does not come free!

- ## Banks charge transaction fees like
  - ### overdraft fee
  - ### returned check/insufficient funds fees
  - ### minimum checking account balance etc.
  
> # PayTech is about attacking this pain point -  reducing transaction costs
  
---

# Now Consider using EFT intead of writing a check 

- ### EFT - Electronic Fund Transfer (eg. direct deposit, online payments)
- ### Uses ACH - Automated Clearing House network instead of the checking system
  - ### An electronic communication system that plugs in to the existing payment infrastructure
  - ### ACH network is run by the central bank (Fed), and a private company called the Clearing House

# EFT using ACH

# Advantages of ACH over Checking system

- ## Cuts down time lage between information flow and money flow
- ## Low cost - through batch processing

> # The low cost of ACH is a primary reason which most PayTech innovations are built on the ACH system

---

# Disadvantage of the ACH system

- ## Not very easy to use
- ## User identifiers (routing/account number) take long to retrieve
- ## Different banks and merchants have different user interfaces (not very user friendly)

> # PayTech innovations take good, but not user-friendly infrastructure, and build user-friendly interfaces on top of it

---

# User friendly Wrappers

- ## User identifiers (phone numbers, email addresses)
  - ### Who remembers routing and account numbers?!
- ## Biometric authentication (face or touch id)
  - ### cumbersome bank level authentication
  
---

# Digital Wallets are....
> # these **wrappers** 

- ## They are built on existing *legacy* infrastructure
- ## They take such information and convert them back into a format that is compatible with existing infrastructure

- ## eg. PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, AliPay...
