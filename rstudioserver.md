# Connecting to RStudio Server

Rather than installing your own copy of R and RStudio, you can access the RStudio Server hosted on our in-house CloudLab. You can run R programs by accessing the RStudio Server via a web browser.


## Accessting RStudio Server

1. __If you are accessing the server from an off-campus location,__ connect to the LSUâ€™s virtual private network (VPN). Follow these steps to connect to the VPN. _If you are connecting from an on-campus computer, or connected to LSU wifi, go to step 2._
  * Download and install the GlobalProtect VPN from [here](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleId=20097)
  * Follow the instructions [here](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=20099) to connect to the VPN
2. Go to [this link](https://130.39.80.67:18443/) to login to the server. _Your web-browsers may give a warning that says "Your connection is not private" or "Your connection is not secure". To proceed, simply choose the "Advanced" link, then choose "Proceed to <link> (unsafe)"_
3. User your LSU __PAWS ID__ (the part before the @ sign of your email) as your username and your __89 number__ as the password.
