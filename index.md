## Course Description

The financial industry is changing rapidly in the face of new technology.  In the past, central governments and financial institutions were at the forefront of innovation in finance. Today, information technology firms and professionals are leading innovation in the financial industry. These innovations have made it possible for consumers to bank via mobile apps integrated into social media, institutions to trade electronically, and robo-advisers to make decisions about investment portfolios.

This special topics course is intended to introduce you to a broad set of financial technologies and approaches referred to as **FinTech** to perform such financial intermediation functions. This course is primarily intended for business majors, especially Finance majors or graduate students interested or specializing in finance. The goal is to provide a fundamental understanding of the forces that impel such innovations and showcase the technological approaches and business models through use cases.  We hope to familiarize you sufficiently with the technology that you can utilize and adapt the technologies in your careers. 

 
<!-- The course will study:
  - How is financial innovation different than industrial innovation? How is financial innovation evolving? What are the light sides and dark sides of financial innovation?
  - Will traditional financial intermediaries be able to adapt? Or will upstart FinTechs disrupt them, re-imagining business models just as Amazon reshaped book-selling and Uber transformed taxi-rides?
  - What are the critical technology strategies and foundational technologies in FinTech?
  - What are the core and novel sources of FinTech data, how are they managed? How is data visualization evolving?
  - What are the primary FinTech data science methods and tools? How do they apply to real FinTech problems and questions today?
  - How is FinTech reconfiguring financial services business models? What are the key disruption points? What determines success in FinTech?
  - Where are the limits, risks, and broader policy and social implications of FinTech?

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this course besides a curious mind and a strong work ethic.  Prior exposure to data science or analytics courses such as FIN 4820 is useful, but not necessary.  
  

## Practical matters

#### Teaching
The class will be team-taught through a mixture of lectures and readings and discussion. There will be periodic speakers from the industry as well.  Students will be expected to work individually and in teams on projects and make presentations. All of these elements are intended to elicit reflection, discussion and creativity.  

#### Textbook and lectures
There's no set textbook for this course. The lecture notes are pretty detailed and are thus *self-contained*. Each lecture will come with a set of readings, which you are expected to have read before class.  Lectures and links to readings will be posted on the [course website](https://lsu-fintech.github.io/4910/).

<!--
#### Github classroom
The class will be taught using [GitHub Classroom](//classroom.github.com/). You will receive an email invitation to the course repo with instructions in due time, but suffice it to say that this is how we'll submit assignments, provide feedback, receive grades, etc.
-->

#### R and RStudio

All projects will use the statistical programming language **R** (download [here](https://www.r-project.org/). You will receive an invite via email to join the class home page in the RStudio Cloud. You will use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) to run all in class programs and submit programming homework assignments. You can also install **R** and the **RStudio IDE** on your computer (download [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).  Both are open-source and/or free. Instructions will be provided when we get to the relevant lecture.  If you are curious and want to get a head start, I can think of no finer guide than Jenny Bryan et al.'s http://happygitwithr.com/ (see esp. sections 4 -- 15).

#### Evaluation and Grading:

*	10% from participation throughout the course
*	30% from case studies and reports in weeks 1-3, and 14
*	30% from mini-project in weeks 5-13
*	30% from the main project

The the LSU [Grading System and Grading Scale](https://catalog.lsu.edu/content.php?catoid=21&navoid=1932#Grading_Systems) will be used to assign letter grades.


## Course Policies

All relevant University policies (including, but not limited to, policies on academic integrity, attendance, etc.) apply to this course. In the case of any conflict between the policies in this syllabus and University policy, University policy applies. We reserve the right to revise, alter, and/or amend this syllabus as necessary. Students will be notified by email of any such revisions, alterations, and/or amendments.

#### Academic Integrity
According to section 10.1 of the [LSU Code of Student Conduct](https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php), “A student may be charged with Academic Misconduct” for a variety of offenses, including the following: unauthorized copying, collusion, or collaboration; “falsifying” data or citations; “assisting someone in the commission or attempted commission of an offense”; and plagiarism, which is defined in section 10.1.H as a “lack of appropriate citation, or the unacknowledged inclusion of someone else's words, structure, ideas, or data; failure to identify a source, or the submission of essentially the same work for two assignments without permission of the instructor(s).”

#### Disability

According to the our General Catalogue, "The Office of Disability Services assists students in identifying and developing accommodations and services to help over-come barriers to the achievement of personal and academic goals. Services are provided for students with temporary or permanent disabilities. Accommodations and services are based on the individual student's disability-based need. Students must provide current documentation of their disabilities. Students should contact the office early so that necessary accommodations can be arranged."

If you have a documented disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please make sure during the first week of the term that you have registered your disability with the [LSU Office of Disability](https://www.lsu.edu/disability/).  Once you are registered, please request that an accomodation letter verifying your disability be sent to us.  Students with infants or young children that need ongoing care should similarly come and see us. We'll have to take it on a case-by-case basis, we will do our utmost to accommodate you.
